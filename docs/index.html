<h3 id="org898666a">WHY MOBILE FIRST?</h3>
<p>
Maintaining a PC based system can be a robust solution, but often it leads to
higher maintenance cost and more number of people to operate. 
</p>
</section>
<section >
<p>
An Android based system can easily be automated, without even needing a single
person to operate.
</p>
</section>
<section >
<p>
Also, scanning a book and automatic entry to the database takes lot less time
than doing it the <i>1960's</i> way.

<h3 id="orga11d188">A BIT OF HISTORY</h3>
<p>
Before the 60's, every single library tasks were performed independent of one
another.
</p>
</section>
<section >
<p>
Selectors ordered materials with slips, catalogues were manually done by card
catalog systems and patrons were required to sign book manually.
</p>

<h4 id="orgfd65318">INTEGRATED LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM</h4>
<p>
In 1970's, the computer storage and telecommunications improved and turnkey
systems on microcomputers were introduced.
</p>
</section>
<section >
<p>
This introduced the Integrated Library Management System or the first proper
computer based library management system, <b>which we still use</b>.
</p>

Nowadays ,The patron has to go and check in the library to get a book
issued.  This hassel of waiting in a queue to know the book
availability.
</p>

</section>
<section id="slide-orgc41f6f3">
<h4 id="orgc41f6f3"></h4>
<p>
To get a book issued, the librarian has to do the long process
of checking the patron and adding the book taken under that patron
manually. There is always a possibility of mismatching the patron's
identity.
</p>

</section>
<section id="slide-orgb5477e7">

<p>
Library System today use's local Database which can be accessed
specifically and which is quite insecure when comes to the security
concern of the system.
</p>

</section>
<section id="slide-org21c7fe6">
<h4 id="org21c7fe6"></h4>
<p>
Additional to the book issued, to return the book back in the
library the patron have to wait for it's turn again and if there is
any fine to be deposited the patron has to go through another queue of
people.
</p>

</section>
<section id="slide-org71fd330">

The patron have to go the library to check the book availabilty

We have proposed some solutions to the shortcomings in last sem's
presentations. Let's recap those once&#x2026;
</p>
</section>
<section id="slide-org2b76576">
<h4 id="org2b76576"></h4>
<p>
Phone based barcode scanning and directly fetching the book data from
Google Books API to automate the process of adding books.
</p>
</section>
<section id="slide-orgf12b6ba">
<h4 id="orgf12b6ba"></h4>
<p>
A database in the cloud to solve the problems of realtime updates and
data security of the library.
</p>
</section>
<section >
<p>
A NoSQL database to solve the problems of structuring data and easier
access control. And lastly,
</p>
</section>
<section >
<p>
<b>A BETTER API FOR EVERYHING</b>
</p>
</section>
<section id="slide-org9c04715">
<h4 id="org9c04715"></h4>
<p>
Android based scanning to solve the automation problems and to remove
those huge 80's chunks of things(that we generally referred to as
<b>DESKTOP COMPUTERS</b>) that today's libraries have.
</p>
</section>
<section >
<p>
<b>ALL THAT PLACE CAN BE USED TO STORE MORE BOOKS</b>
</p>

The app is designed for librarians and the patrons seperately and mostly
focuses on the needs of the user with more friendly UI, easy to access and
understand.
</p>
</section>
<section id="slide-org17ba221">
<h4 id="org17ba221"></h4>
<p>
To ease the headaches of the librarians as well the patron, the program uses
Google Book API services for retrieveing book information with included
barcode scaning to facilitate the actions.
</p>
</section>
<section id="slide-org7ead438">
<h4 id="org7ead438"></h4>
<p>
For effective data fetching, Google Firebase database is used which
provides a realtime database which is a NoSQL Database and as the data is
stored in Firebase cloud the stored data is secured as compared to the
backdated local database.  
</p>
</section>
<section id="slide-org7eb9269">
<h4 id="org7eb9269"></h4>
<p>
To save time and effort of everyday, This API is faster and better way of
overcoming all the bunch of steps to get a book issued with a single click
and moreover facilitates more library functions without moving anywhere!
